[Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) is the largest online encyclopedia in the world. Most of our research / investigation starts from Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a facinating enviornment because its a knowledge repository manage and constructed by people like you and me. Therefore we should be concern if user demographics has an impact on the content of wikipedia articles. New York Times publish an article claiming that there exist a Gender Gap in wikipedia content providers.

At GroupLens we are bunch of cuirios people. Plus we thought New York times didn't do the justice and made stereo typical arguments. We decided to carry out a scientific exploration to study if New York times got it right. So with the guidance of Professor John Riedl, Tony Lam and I carried out a research project answer few research questions. Our results were facinating we ended up publishing a conference paper and won the Best student paper for it. 

Here are some of our findings:  

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
