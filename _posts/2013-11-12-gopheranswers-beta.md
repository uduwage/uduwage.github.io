  [GopherAnswers](http://gopheranswers.umn.edu) Beta Release is up and running
</div>

For almost a year I have been building GopherAnswers, online question and answer site for my research. Last December my advisor and I wrote a NSF grant to carry out research in Question and Answer site and a part of that research was to build a question and answer site where we can run A/B testing to test our hypothesis. I am super excited to launch the beta version of our site. Check out [gopheranswers.umn.edu](http://gopheranswers.umn.edu)
