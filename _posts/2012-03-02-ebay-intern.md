After few rounds of fun interview rounds spanning from Algorithms to statistics to research ideas, I finally landed a [eBay](http://ebay.com) Research Intern position. I will be working with Catalog and Classifican team focussing on building price prediction models. Based what I can publically write, I plan to document my experience. Stay tune!!!
