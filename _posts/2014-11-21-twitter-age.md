Recently I worked on an interesting prediction problem. It was predicting Twitter users age. I was given few set of files which basically had the twitter data dumps in json format.

Since at some point I will write a longer post realted to how I build the model, my error rates etc. But here is a plot of predicted ages where X axis showing ages and Y axis showing how many users per age. This prediction from model unseen data. Its interesting that data is skewed towards to common intiution where younger people are active in online communities.
