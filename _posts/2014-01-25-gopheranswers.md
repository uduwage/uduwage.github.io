Starting today we are moving GopherAnswers from Beta to full release version. So all the University of Minnesota students can use [gopheranswers.umn.edu](http://gopheranswers.umn.edu) as their primary information source. It can be related to UofM, studies, classes, housing, food and many other things that you are curious about. As a UofM student you don't have to worry about creating another account login to GopherAnswers. We have connected it with your U of M login system which reduce the hassle of maintaining another login credential. So enjoy and get busy asking and answering questions.
