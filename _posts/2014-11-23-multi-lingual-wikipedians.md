#Multilingual Wikipedians - Proficiency and its effect

<div class="message">
        Different proficency level leads to different areas of work!!!
</div>

I have been working with Wikipedia data for sometime. As a non-native English speaker I am naturally interested in impact of multilingual Wikipedians to Wikipedia platform. As a researcher I wanted to dig into this further and wanted to understand Multlingual Wikipedians edit behavior and what type of impact they bring in to the Wikipedia. I plant to write my results as a series of posts as time permits. 

This study is seperated into two main sections, **Movement between Wikipedia domains** and **Area of Contribution**. 

Areas of Contribution
---------------------
Each Wikipedia has multiple areas interms of Wikipedia "lingo" it's called [Namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Namespace). Each namespace is a reserved name in the MediaWiki platform. For example, in the user namespace all titles begin with "User".

As you can see each subject namespace has its talk namespace for example "main" which is the article namespace where all the articles are at has its "Talk" namespace. Talk namespace is defined for users to discuss information related to the topic. Example, if a wikipedia edit is working on article which is the "Main" namespace that user would discuss about that article and its related information and issues in "Talk" (1) with other users. You can read all the descriptions of namespaces by going to above links. 

Wikipedia is community driven information center. Given these namespaces, it is interesting to see if language proficency of a user/contributor has an impact on the type of work and edtior does, type of content and editor works on, and quality of the work of the work that editor performs?

####How do we identify editor's proficiency level?
User's can publish their language and proficiency level of the language in their user page (user profile page) with the help of Babel [Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Babel)

Users can use this template to display the language proficiency, it is self-reported. We collect 286 languages users information and their edit history to generate what part of propotion of their edits to each main namespaces and talk namespaces.
