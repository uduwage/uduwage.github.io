title: About
---

I am a PhD student at University of Minnesota. My research interest are within the scope of Recommender Systems and modeling behavioral patterns of users in online communities.

I was lucky enough to have Dr. John Riedl as my advisor during my early stage of PhD life. After a hard fought battle with Melanoma John passed away in June of 2013. There is not a day I miss him. He was more than an advisor to both myself and mywife. In a world where many advisor go after fame and publicity he focus on doing good research and doing it in the right way. If you walk into his room with a question you would never walk out as a frustrated grad student. He had an amazing ability to ask the right question that you may not have ask and at the end of the day you walk out from that room with an answer or path to an answer in your head while feeling fantastic. 

I am super lucky to be married to my smart, articulate, curly headed, and beautiful wife who I call "Adare". Our home away from home is lovely old town (Alexandria, VA). In case if you wonder how come a PhD candidate from Minneapolis call Alexandria as home. Answer is tavel during weekend.
